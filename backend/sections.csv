1,1,Section 5: Data Localisation Mandates,All sensitive personal data of Indian citizens must be stored exclusively on servers located within India.,"Data sovereignty is important, but mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups. This will create data silos and hinder access to global cloud services that offer superior security and scalability. A more pragmatic approach would be to mandate a copy of the data to be stored in India, while allowing processing on global infrastructure.","Data sovereignty is important, but mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups.

My vacation photos are surely a matter of national security and must be protected from foreign eyes at all costs. I feel so much safer knowing my data will be stored on a local server, which will undoubtedly be just as secure and efficient as the multi-billion dollar infrastructures run by global tech giants. A truly visionary move for a self-reliant digital future.","Section 5 is a startup killer. The capital expenditure required to comply with data localisation is prohibitive for early-stage companies. This creates a protectionist moat for large, established players and foreign corporations with deep pockets. This directly harms the government's ""Startup India"" initiative. We strongly recommend this clause be entirely removed to ensure a level playing field for domestic innovators.","Mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups.

2,1,Section 12: Intermediary Liability and Safe Harbour,Redefines the conditions under which social media platforms are granted safe harbour protections.,"The proposed framework for intermediary liability appears to conflate the roles of publisher and platform. This will force platforms to engage in pre-emptive censorship just to avoid litigation, which is a detriment to public discourse. For too long, large social media platforms have hidden behind ""safe harbour"" while profiting from the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Freedom of speech is not the freedom to cause harm without consequence.","The proposed framework for intermediary liability appears to conflate the roles of publisher and platform.

This will force every tech platform to become a censor. Our small startup cannot afford a massive legal team to review every user comment. We will be forced to either over-censor and alienate our users, or face crippling lawsuits. This section disproportionately harms new Indian startups and creates an insurmountable barrier to entry.","For too long social media platforms have hidden behind ""safe harbour"" while profiting from the spread of misinformation and hate speech. This change rightfully places the onus on them to invest more in moderation and be accountable for the content they amplify. Freedom of speech is not the freedom to cause harm without consequence.

3,1,Section 22: Regulation of AI Models,Establishes a regulatory body to classify and audit high-risk AI systems deployed in critical sectors.,"The potential for AI to cause widespread harm in areas like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and algorithmic trading is significant. Leaving such technologies completely unregulated would be a dereliction of the state's duty to protect its citizens. A pre-approval system will drastically increase the time-to-market for innovative AI products. Let the market decide which products succeed, with the government stepping in only when harm is demonstrated.","A pre-approval system will drastically increase the time-to-market for innovative AI products. Let the market decide which products succeed, with the government stepping in only when harm is demonstrated.","A government body to regulate AI? Wonderful! I'm sure a committee of lifelong bureaucrats will have the nuanced technical expertise to fairly audit complex neural networks. They will certainly make unbiased, lightning-fast decisions that foster innovation. I eagerly await the simplified, 300-page form we'll need to fill out in triplicate to get our new AI-powered toaster approved.","Section 22 is a necessary step, but the term ""high-risk AI"" is dangerously ambiguous. The draft must provide a concrete, annexed list of what constitutes critical sectors and high-risk applications. The UK’s model of pro-innovation, sector-specific regulation is a far better approach.","The potential for AI to cause widespread harm in areas like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and algorithmic trading is significant. Leaving such technologies completely unregulated would be a dereliction of the state's duty to protect its citizens.

4,2,Section 8: Mandatory ESG Reporting,All listed companies with a turnover above Rs. 500 Cr must publish an annual ESG report based on a standardized format.,"For too long, companies have paid lip service to social and environmental responsibilities. A standardized ESG reporting format will finally allow investors and the public to compare apples to apples. The cost of compliance is a small price to pay for building long-term, sustainable and ethical businesses. The proposed timeline for implementation of mandatory ESG report is overly aggressive.","A standardized ESG reporting format will finally allow investors and the public to compare apples to apples.

The cost of compliance is a small price to pay for building long-term, sustainable and ethical businesses. Section 8 will bring a new era of corporate transparency and allow us to verify the claims companies make in their press releases. We strongly support its implementation without any dilution.","The government’s standardized ESG format in Section 8 is too rigid and focuses excessively on compliance rather than impact. A one-year transition period is insufficient. We recommend a phased rollout over three years, starting with the top 100 companies by market capitalization and then expanding the scope gradually. This will ensure higher quality of disclosures.","The concept of ESG reporting is sound, but the format and details should not be a one-size-fits-all solution dictated by the government. Industry bodies like CII and FICCI should be allowed to develop sector-specific frameworks that are more relevant and less burdensome. Let the experts, not the bureaucrats, define what makes sense for each industry.",static/wordclouds\sections\section_4_overall.png,static/wordclouds\sections\section_4_positive.png,static/wordclouds\sections\section_4_negative.png,static/wordclouds\sections\section_4_neutral.png
5,2,Section 15: Independent Director Quotas,Mandates that at least 50% of the board members of listed companies must be Independent Directors.,"The proposal in Section 15 to have 50% independent directors is operationally unworkable and counterproductive. A board heavily skewed towards non-executive directors who lack deep, intrinsic knowledge of the company's operations can lead to poor strategic decision-making. Mandating a 50% quota under Section 15 will lead to the same set of individuals sitting on multiple boards.","The proposal in Section 15 to have 50% independent directors is operationally unworkable and counterproductive.

Mandating a 50% quota under Section 15 will lead to the same set of individuals sitting on multiple boards.","I completely support raising the quota of independent directors to 50%. This is about balancing power. Independent directors bring diverse experience, an outside view, and a focus on long-term strategy, governance, and ethics. A 50-50 balance ensures that neither side can dominate the board and that decisions are made more democratically and with greater scrutiny.","The proposal in Section 15 to have 50% independent directors is operationally unworkable and counterproductive. A better approach is to strengthen the definition of ""independence"" and enhance the role and power of the audit and nomination committees. We recommend a stricter definition of independence, a mandatory cooling-off period, and a cap on the total number of independent directors.","Mandating a 50% quota under Section 15 will lead to the same set of individuals sitting on multiple boards, which defeats the purpose. The focus should be on building capacity and training a new generation of independent directors before enforcing such a drastic quota. The intent of increasing independent directors is good but the pool of qualified, truly independent individuals in India is limited.",static/wordclouds\sections\section_5_overall.png,static/wordclouds\sections\section_5_positive.png,static/wordclouds\sections\section_5_negative.png,static/wordclouds\sections\section_5_neutral.png
6,2,Section 21: Executive Compensation Caps,"Introduces a cap on the cash component of executive compensation, linking it to the median employee salary.","Section 21, which caps executive compensation, is well-intentioned but misguided. Companies must be free to offer competitive salaries to attract the best leaders. Linking pay to the median salary is a flawed metric that doesn't account for skill, risk, and global market rates for leadership. It will simply incentivize companies to outsource low-wage jobs to manipulate the median.","Section 21, which caps executive compensation, is well-intentioned but misguided. Companies must be free to offer competitive salaries to attract the best leaders. Linking pay to the median salary is a flawed metric that doesn't account for skill, risk, and global market rates for leadership.",A cap on CEO salaries? Bravo! I'm sure this will magically solve income inequality overnight. Top executives will surely find newfound humility and work purely for the love of the game. It’s a good thing talent is not a global commodity and that our best leaders would never dream of moving to a company in Singapore or Dubai for a better pay package.,"Section 21, which caps executive compensation, is well-intentioned but misguided.

7,3,Section 4: Solar Power Subsidies,Details the subsidy structure for rooftop solar panel installations for residential and commercial properties.,"The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities. There is no clear provision for low-income households or housing societies. The policy should include a zero-upfront-cost EMI model or community solar projects to ensure the green transition is equitable and does not leave the poor behind.","The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities.

The upfront cost is still too high, even with the discount, and the process to get the subsidy is full of red tape. This policy only seems to benefit the solar panel manufacturing companies. The government should focus on providing reliable, cheap grid electricity instead of pushing us towards these complex solutions.","The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities.

8,3,Section 9: Carbon Tax Implementation,A phased implementation of a carbon tax on industries based on their greenhouse gas emissions.,"A carbon tax is necessary, but Section 9 unfairly clubs all industries together. The tax structure needs to be highly granulated by sector, with different rates and timelines. The revenue generated from this tax must be statutorily ring-fenced and used exclusively for funding renewable energy projects and supporting communities affected by the transition. The introduction of a carbon tax in Section 9 is an economically and environmentally sound policy.","A carbon tax is necessary, but Section 9 unfairly clubs all industries together.

By internalizing the external cost of pollution, it creates a powerful market-based incentive for companies to innovate and reduce their emissions. The revenue generated from this tax must be statutorily ring-fenced and used exclusively for funding renewable energy projects.","A carbon tax is necessary, but Section 9 unfairly clubs all industries together. A steel plant and a software company have vastly different carbon footprints and abilities to transition. Applying a uniform tax will disproportionately harm our manufacturing sector, while having little impact on the service industry. The government must provide significant grants and technological support for us to transition to greener methods.","Our company is already investing thousands of crores in green hydrogen and other renewable energy projects, driven by market demand and our own corporate strategy. The proposed carbon tax in Section 9 is an unnecessary and punitive measure that disincentivizes voluntary action. It is a blunt instrument that does not recognize the proactive steps being taken by responsible corporations.

9,3,Section 14: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure,Mandates all new commercial buildings to allocate 10% of parking space for EV charging stations.,"The mandate for EV charging stations in new buildings is a good idea, but 10% is too low to be meaningful. Section 9 will lead to job losses in traditional sectors like coal and thermal power. The revenue from the tax cannot just go to new green projects; a significant portion must be allocated to provide social security.","The mandate for EV charging stations in new buildings is a good idea, but 10% is too low to be meaningful.

""This policy will correctly incentivize a shift in investment from carbon-intensive old-economy sectors to modern, clean-tech industries like ours,"" it adds. ""It levels the playing field by making polluters pay for their negative externalities""","A carbon tax is a regressive tax that will be passed on to the consumers. It will lead to job losses in traditional sectors like coal and thermal power. This is not the right time to introduce such a policy when we are already dealing with inflation. The government should provide incentives for going green, not penalties.","The mandate for EV charging stations in new buildings is a good idea, but 10% is too low to be meaningful.
