1,"The Digital India Act, 2025","A comprehensive framework for data protection, intermediary liability, and regulation of emerging technologies.",2025-10-05 17:08:05,"Data sovereignty is important, but mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups. This will create data silos and hinder access to global cloud services that offer superior security and scalability. A more pragmatic approach would be to mandate a copy of the data to be stored in India, while allowing processing on global infrastructure.","A government body to regulate AI? Wonderful! I'm sure a committee of lifelong bureaucrats will have the nuanced technical expertise to fairly audit complex neural networks. They will certainly make unbiased, lightning-fast decisions that foster innovation. I eagerly await the simplified, 300-page form we'll need to fill out in triplicate to get our new AI-powered toaster approved.","Section 5 is a startup killer. The capital expenditure required to comply with data localisation is prohibitive for early-stage companies. This creates a protectionist moat for large, established players and foreign corporations with deep pockets. We strongly recommend this clause be entirely removed to ensure a level playing field for domestic innovators.Section 12 is a recipe for disaster. This will force every tech platform to become a censor.","Mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups.

For too long social media platforms have hidden behind ""safe harbour"" while profiting from the spread of misinformation and hate speech.",static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_1_overall.png,static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_1_positive.png,static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_1_negative.png,static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_1_neutral.png
2,"The Corporate Governance and ESG Disclosure Bill, 2025","A bill to enforce stricter corporate governance norms and mandatory Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting.",2025-10-05 17:08:05,"The proposed timeline for implementation of mandatory ESG report is overly aggressive. For too long, companies have paid lip service to social and environmental responsibilities. A standardized ESG reporting format will finally allow investors and the public to compare apples to apples. The cost of compliance is a small price to pay for building long-term, sustainable and ethical businesses.","A cap on CEO salaries? Bravo! I'm sure this will magically solve income inequality overnight. Top executives will surely find newfound humility and work purely for the love of the game. A standardized ESG reporting format will finally allow investors and the public to compare apples to apples. The cost of compliance is a small price to pay for building long-term, sustainable and ethical businesses.","The governmentâ€™s standardized ESG format in Section 8 is too rigid and focuses excessively on compliance rather than impact. The proposal in Section 15 to have 50% independent directors is operationally unworkable and counterproductive. Linking pay to the median salary is a flawed metric that doesn't account for skill, risk, and global market rates for leadership.","The concept of ESG reporting is sound, but the format and details should not be a one-size-fits-all solution dictated by the government. Industry bodies like CII and FICCI should be allowed to develop sector-specific frameworks that are more relevant and less burdensome. Let the experts, not the bureaucrats, define what makes sense for each industry.",static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_2_overall.png,static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_2_positive.png,static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_2_negative.png,static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_2_neutral.png
3,"The National Green Energy Framework, 2025","Policy outlining subsidies, carbon taxes, and infrastructure development for renewable energy.",2025-10-05 17:08:05,"The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities. There is no clear provision for low-income households or housing societies. The policy should include a zero-upfront-cost EMI model or community solar projects to ensure the green transition is equitable and does not leave the poor behind.","""As a tech company with a minimal carbon footprint, we fully support the carbon tax in Section 9,"" the company says. ""This policy will correctly incentivize a shift in investment from carbon-intensive old-economy sectors to modern, clean-tech industries like ours,"" it adds. ""It levels the playing field by making polluters pay for their negative externalities""","A carbon tax is necessary, but Section 9 unfairly clubs all industries together. A steel plant and a software company have vastly different carbon footprints. Applying a uniform tax will disproportionately harm our manufacturing sector, while having little impact on the service industry. The government must provide significant grants and technological support for us to transition to greener methods.","The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities.
