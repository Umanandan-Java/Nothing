1,1,Section 5: Data Localisation Mandates,All sensitive personal data of Indian citizens must be stored exclusively on servers located within India.,"Data sovereignty is important, but mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups. This will create data silos and hinder access to global cloud services that offer superior security and scalability. A more pragmatic approach would be to mandate a copy of the data to be stored in India, while allowing processing on global infrastructure.","Data sovereignty is important, but mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups.

2,1,Section 12: Intermediary Liability and Safe Harbour,Redefines the conditions under which social media platforms are granted safe harbour protections.,"The proposed framework for intermediary liability appears to conflate the roles of publisher and platform. This will force platforms to engage in pre-emptive censorship just to avoid litigation, which is a detriment to public discourse. For too long, large social media platforms have hidden behind ""safe harbour"" while profiting from the spread of misinformation and hate speech. Freedom of speech is not the freedom to cause harm without consequence.","The proposed framework for intermediary liability appears to conflate the roles of publisher and platform.

3,1,Section 22: Regulation of AI Models,Establishes a regulatory body to classify and audit high-risk AI systems deployed in critical sectors.,"The potential for AI to cause widespread harm in areas like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and algorithmic trading is significant. Leaving such technologies completely unregulated would be a dereliction of the state's duty to protect its citizens. A pre-approval system will drastically increase the time-to-market for innovative AI products. Let the market decide which products succeed, with the government stepping in only when harm is demonstrated.","A pre-approval system will drastically increase the time-to-market for innovative AI products.

4,2,Section 8: Mandatory ESG Reporting,All listed companies with a turnover above Rs. 500 Cr must publish an annual ESG report based on a standardized format.,"For too long, companies have paid lip service to social and environmental responsibilities. A standardized ESG reporting format will finally allow investors and the public to compare apples to apples. The cost of compliance is a small price to pay for building long-term, sustainable and ethical businesses. The proposed timeline for implementation of mandatory ESG report is overly aggressive.","A standardized ESG reporting format will finally allow investors and the public to compare apples to apples.

5,2,Section 15: Independent Director Quotas,Mandates that at least 50% of the board members of listed companies must be Independent Directors.,"The proposal in Section 15 to have 50% independent directors is operationally unworkable and counterproductive. A board heavily skewed towards non-executive directors who lack deep, intrinsic knowledge of the company's operations can lead to poor strategic decision-making. Mandating a 50% quota under Section 15 will lead to the same set of individuals sitting on multiple boards.","The proposal in Section 15 to have 50% independent directors is operationally unworkable and counterproductive.

6,2,Section 21: Executive Compensation Caps,"Introduces a cap on the cash component of executive compensation, linking it to the median employee salary.","Section 21, which caps executive compensation, is well-intentioned but misguided. Companies must be free to offer competitive salaries to attract the best leaders. Linking pay to the median salary is a flawed metric that doesn't account for skill, risk, and global market rates for leadership. It will simply incentivize companies to outsource low-wage jobs to manipulate the median.","Section 21, which caps executive compensation, is well-intentioned but misguided.

7,3,Section 4: Solar Power Subsidies,Details the subsidy structure for rooftop solar panel installations for residential and commercial properties.,"The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities. There is no clear provision for low-income households or housing societies. The policy should include a zero-upfront-cost EMI model or community solar projects to ensure the green transition is equitable and does not leave the poor behind.","The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities.

8,3,Section 9: Carbon Tax Implementation,A phased implementation of a carbon tax on industries based on their greenhouse gas emissions.,"A carbon tax is necessary, but Section 9 unfairly clubs all industries together. The tax structure needs to be highly granulated by sector, with different rates and timelines. The revenue generated from this tax must be statutorily ring-fenced and used exclusively for funding renewable energy projects and supporting communities affected by the transition. The introduction of a carbon tax in Section 9 is an economically and environmentally sound policy.","A carbon tax is necessary, but Section 9 unfairly clubs all industries together.

9,3,Section 14: Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure,Mandates all new commercial buildings to allocate 10% of parking space for EV charging stations.,"The mandate for EV charging stations in new buildings is a good idea, but 10% is too low to be meaningful. Section 9 will lead to job losses in traditional sectors like coal and thermal power. The revenue from the tax cannot just go to new green projects; a significant portion must be allocated to provide social security.","The mandate for EV charging stations in new buildings is a good idea, but 10% is too low to be meaningful.
