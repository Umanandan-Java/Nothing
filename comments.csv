42,104,8,In Agreement,"This carbon tax is a very good step. As a responsible businessman, I believe all industries must be accountable for their impact on the environment. For too long, pollution has been a cost borne by society, not by the polluter. Section 9 finally corrects this. It will be challenging initially, but it will force us all to become more efficient and innovative in the long run, which is good for the country and for our future generations.",9/29/2025 5:55,,Positive,0.823003411,"For too long, pollution has been a cost borne by society, not by the polluter,"" user says.

43,115,8,Suggest modification,"So now we add a carbon tax that makes everything more expensive for the middle class, while large corporations with smart accountants will find loopholes to avoid it. I'm sure the tax revenue will be used with 100% efficiency and will definitely not get lost in bureaucracy. It is comforting to know that my higher electricity bill is directly helping plant a tree somewhere, probably. A truly equitable way to solve a global crisis.",9/29/2025 5:55,,Neutral,0.463894695,"So now we add a carbon tax that makes everything more expensive for the middle class, while large corporations with smart accountants will find loopholes to avoid it,"" one user commented.

44,102,9,Suggest modification,"The legality of a central government-imposed carbon tax as per Section 9 might face challenges from states, as taxation on production and land use often falls under state jurisdiction. The draft should clarify the constitutional basis for this tax and create a clear mechanism for revenue sharing with the states to avoid legal disputes. Without state cooperation, the implementation of this tax will be mired in legal battles.",9/29/2025 5:55,,Neutral,0.667506278,"The legality of a central government-imposed carbon tax as per section 9 might face challenges from states, as taxation on production and land use often falls under state jurisdiction,"" user says.

45,106,9,In Agreement,"As a tech company with a minimal carbon footprint, we fully support the carbon tax in Section 9. This policy will correctly incentivize a shift in investment from carbon-intensive old-economy sectors to modern, clean-tech industries like ours. It levels the playing field by making polluters pay for their negative externalities. This will accelerate the transition to a greener, technology-driven economy.",9/29/2025 5:55,,Positive,0.826810539,"As a tech company with a minimal carbon footprint, we fully support the carbon tax in section 9,"" the company says.

The proposed carbon tax in Section 9 is an unnecessary and punitive measure that disincentivizes voluntary action.
