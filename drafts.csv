1,"The Digital India Act, 2025","A comprehensive framework for data protection, intermediary liability, and regulation of emerging technologies.",2025-09-29 05:55:05,"Data sovereignty is important, but mandating exclusive storage within India is technically challenging and financially burdensome for startups. This will create data silos and hinder access to global cloud services that offer superior security and scalability. A more pragmatic approach would be to mandate a copy of the data to be stored in India, while allowing processing on global infrastructure. The potential for AI to cause widespread harm in areas like autonomous vehicles, medical diagnostics, and algorithmic trading is significant. Leaving such technologies completely unregulated would be a dereliction of the state's duty to protect its citizens.",static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_1.png
2,"The Corporate Governance and ESG Disclosure Bill, 2025","A bill to enforce stricter corporate governance norms and mandatory Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting.",2025-09-29 05:55:05,"The proposed timeline for implementation of mandatory ESG report is overly aggressive. For too long, companies have paid lip service to social and environmental responsibilities. A standardized ESG reporting format will finally allow investors and the public to compare apples to apples. The cost of compliance is a small price to pay for building long-term, sustainable and ethical businesses. The proposal in Section 15 to have 50% independent directors is operationally unworkable and counterproductive. A board heavily skewed towards non-executive directors who lack deep, intrinsic knowledge of the company's operations can lead to poor strategic decisions.",static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_2.png
3,"The National Green Energy Framework, 2025","Policy outlining subsidies, carbon taxes, and infrastructure development for renewable energy.",2025-09-29 05:55:05,"The solar subsidy structure in Section 4 is a positive start, but it disproportionately benefits wealthy individuals and large commercial entities. There is no clear provision for low-income households or housing societies. The policy should include a zero-upfront-cost EMI model or community solar projects to ensure the green transition is equitable and does not leave the poor behind. Section 9 will lead to job losses in traditional sectors like coal and thermal power. The revenue from the tax cannot just go to new green projects; a significant portion must be allocated to provide social security.",static/wordclouds\drafts\draft_3.png
